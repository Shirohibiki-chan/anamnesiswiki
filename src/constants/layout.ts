// Layout numbers that more than one file has to agree on.

// How far one level of nesting shifts a sidebar row, in pixels. react-arborist
// takes this as a prop and defaults to 24; `TreeItem` positions its indent
// guide lines from the same number, so the two have to read it from one place
// or the lines drift away from the rows they belong to.
//
// 18 rather than the library's 24: at eight or nine levels deep the difference
// is most of a folder name. The guide lines are what make the tighter spacing
// still readable — don't lower this further without them.

/**
 * How wide the two side panels can be dragged, in pixels, and where they start.
 *
 * The defaults are the widths both panels were fixed at before Phase 14 made
 * them draggable, so nobody's window changes shape on upgrade.
 *
 * The minimums are the point below which the panel stops being able to do its
 * job rather than an arbitrary floor: the tree at 180 still shows a name at
 * four levels of indent, and the properties panel at 220 still fits a label and
 * a value on one line. **Don't lower either to "0 to hide it"** — hiding is a
 * different action with a different control, and a panel dragged to nothing is
 * a panel the user can't find the edge of to drag back.
 *
 * The maximums exist because `.app-layout-center` is the `1fr` between them:
 * without a cap, two panels dragged wide on a small window leave the page they
 * describe with no room to render in.
