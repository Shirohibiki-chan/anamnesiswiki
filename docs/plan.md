# Anamnesis — Implementation Plan

---

## Project Overview

Anamnesis is a Tauri v2 desktop app for local-first worldbuilding. React 19 + TypeScript in the renderer, Rust shell handling filesystem access. Data lives as JSON files on disk in a folder the user picks. BlockNote provides the Notion-style block editor. LegendKeeper's `.lk` export format is supported as a first-class import/export path so the user can migrate their existing world.

Work phases top-down. Do not start a phase until the previous one is complete and usable. Each phase should end with the app in a coherent, working state — not mid-refactor. Phases are sized to be reviewable as user-facing changes.

**Position is the running order; the number is only a name.** A phase gets its number when it's written down, so a phase that gets pulled forward keeps its number and moves up the file — Phase 27 sat above Phase 18 for exactly that reason until it shipped. Read the order off the page, not off the digits, and when something moves, move the section rather than renumbering everything below it.

See `docs/spec.md` for the full spec, `CLAUDE.md` for architecture rules, and `docs/prototype/anamnesis.jsx` for a reference React prototype that demonstrates layout and tree behavior (its template content is filler — the real copy lives in `src/services/template-registry.ts`).

## Future Features

Parked in [ideas.md](ideas.md), so this file stays focused on active work.

---

## Queued Adjustments

- **The colour dot on every tree row is in the wrong place, and the folder
  colour feature wants an overhaul.** Both flagged by the user 2026-08-18, with
  a screenshot; she said plainly she'd deal with the overhaul later, so this is
  a marker, not a brief. What's known: the circle sitting between a row's name
  and its ⋯ menu (`tree-row-color-dot`, `TreeItem.tsx`) is unwanted *there* —
  that's placement, not the ability to colour a page. **The overhaul itself is
  undesigned and must be asked about rather than guessed at**, the same rule the
  search scope controls carry below. Don't quietly move the dot into the ⋯ menu
  as a fix; that's a design decision wearing a tidy-up's clothes, and it's hers.
  Related: icons you choose yourself, in `docs/ideas.md`.

- **Find out what our own copy and paste actually does, before building any
  importer on top of it.** Raised 2026-08-12 by what botmakers said about the
  tool they're leaving (see `docs/ideas.md` → Import and paste fidelity): the
  formatting complaints were as much about pasting in and out as about file
  import, and paste is a code path nothing here has ever looked at. BlockNote
  handles the clipboard itself.

  This is a measurement, not a build, and it's cheap: paste a spaced document
  in from Google Docs, from Word, and from a plain text editor, and check
  whether blank lines survive and whether any heading or bold appears that
  wasn't there. Then copy a page *out* into a plain textarea and see what comes
  with it. **Write the answer down either way** — if it's already right, that's
  a baseline the importer must not regress; if it's wrong, it's a bug we ship
  today and don't know about, and it makes the whole import feature moot until
  fixed.

- **LegendKeeper's controls for a picture in a page, which the user pointed at
  2026-08-11 as the shape to match.** Two parts, neither built here yet:
  - **Buttons that appear over the picture on hover** — change image, reposition,
    expand — in the top corner, the same idea as the sidebar slot's own hover
    toolbar.
  - **A right-click / dots menu on the block**, holding: Title / No Title, a
    colour row, Change image, Fit to image, Link to page (with a page search),
    Layout, Duplicate, Delete, Insert row below.

  What exists instead today is BlockNote's formatting toolbar (which now carries
  Open full size and Save a copy) plus double-click to open. **The hover buttons
  mean rendering into BlockNote's own block DOM**, which is the part to think
  about before starting rather than the buttons themselves. Several of the menu
  entries — Link to page, Layout, Insert row below — are really Phase 18 sidebar
  blocks wearing a different hat, so check that phase before treating this as one
  job.

- **The About dialog never got built.** The other half of a Phase 12 bullet
  whose first half shipped as Settings → Patch Notes on 2026-08-08. Small and
  self-contained — version, licence, the fonts' licences, a link to the repo.
  Left here rather than folded into a phase because it belongs to none of them.

- **The app's *default* fonts are still Inter / Fraunces / Newsreader.** The
  98-family library ships, so nothing is blocked on bundling — but
  `--font-ui` / `--font-display` / `--font-prose`'s defaults in `index.css` are
  what someone sees before they touch anything, and moving those is **her
  decision, not a build.** Ask; don't pick for her. Phase 12 closed without it
  because it was never a task.

- **The search scope controls are not the design that was wanted.** Shipped
  2026-08-09 and judged *"serviceable for now"* the same day — kept, not
  accepted. The user chose to move on rather than redesign it then, so **the
  specifics are not recorded and must be asked for, not guessed.** What is
  known:
  - *Sidebar:* a menu that opens on clicking into an empty field is not the
    interaction she pictured. The first attempt was three always-visible
    pills, rejected 2026-08-08 as *"unprofessional and lame"*; the menu was
    the answer to that and is closer, not right.
  - *Ctrl-K:* she described wanting *"filtering stuff and tabs"* (2026-08-08).
    What shipped puts all four scopes behind a Tab press, which is a smaller
    idea than the one she described and reads as nothing being there. Her own
    words on the goal: *"i'd prefer a more robust UI."*
  - Both are two attempts in without landing, which is the signal to design
    it with her before building a third.

- **Valeraverse needs re-importing once, and hasn't been.** Two import changes
  landed after her copy was brought in: the project home arriving as a real page,
  and each picture remembering the LK address it came from (without which export
  can't send pictures back). Both apply at import time only, so her existing
  project has neither. One re-import picks up both — worth doing in a single
  pass rather than twice.

---

## Known Bugs

- **The AppImage won't start on some older Linux systems.** Reported 2026-08-09
  from the first install by someone who isn't the user: it ran on his new
  laptop and failed on an older Fedora one. His diagnosis, verbatim — *"the GTK
  libraries the ones bundled in the appimage were failing to talk to EGL and I
  had to use the system's own libwayland-client myself."* He got it running; a
  person installing the app could not have.

  **This is the standard AppImage bundling mistake and it has a known shape.**
  Graphics and display libraries — `libwayland-client`, `libEGL`, `libGL`,
  `libgbm`, `libdrm`, driver shims — are bound to the host's kernel and GPU
  stack and must come *from the host*, never from the bundle. AppImage's own
  project publishes an excludelist saying exactly this, and `linuxdeploy`
  honours it; Tauri's bundler copies webkit2gtk's dependency tree without
  consulting it, which is how the wrong `libwayland-client` ends up inside.
  The build is on `ubuntu-22.04` (`.github/workflows/release.yml`), so the
  bundled copies are Ubuntu 22.04's — newer than what an older Fedora carries,
  which is why the new laptop was fine and the old one wasn't.

  **Don't fix this blind.** The fix is to stop bundling those libraries, and
  the way to know it worked is a machine that reproduces the failure — this
  repo has none, and CI runs the same Ubuntu that produces the bad bundle. Ask
  him to confirm the exact library and error before changing the workflow;
  guessing produces an AppImage that's differently broken on a machine nobody
  here can boot. The `.deb` is unaffected, since it resolves against the
  system's own packages, and is the better thing to point Fedora/RPM users at
  in the meantime (or `.rpm`, which `targets: "all"` already builds).

## Shipped

Phases 0–15 are complete. **`docs/shipped.md`** has what each one delivered;
`CHANGELOG.md` has the same story in plain language. **Phase 1.5 (Publish) is
the only unstarted phase behind us** — it's unblocked and unscheduled, below.

Project home — the last Queued Adjustment standing before Phase 9 — shipped
2026-07-31.

**Phase 10 closed 2026-07-31** when the signing key went into the repository's
Actions secrets, which was the one step nothing in the repo was allowed to do.
Search, keyboard shortcuts, rebinding, tabbed Settings, sidebar undo/redo and
automated four-platform releases all landed that day. Two things it deliberately
left behind: undo for the right-hand panel, now **Phase 19**, and the
duplicate-on-multi-selection fix, folded into **Phase 15** where that menu gets
reworked anyway. Neither blocks anything.

**The app is shippable.** Anyone can install it, updates reach them, and
nothing about anyone's world leaves their machine.

**Phase 9 left one thing open, and it can't be closed from here:** nothing has
been imported into real LegendKeeper from a file we wrote. The round trip is
verified through our own importer against the real 75-resource
`Valeraverse.lk`, which proves the mapping is self-consistent — not that LK
accepts it. That needs an LK account and an import attempt. See
`docs/handoff.md` §Known gaps.

---

## Phase 1.5 — Publish

**Unblocked as of 2026-07-31** — Phase 10 was the thing in front of it.

`PublishModal.tsx` with checkbox tree of what to publish, "include hidden tabs?" toggle (default off), tag filter, output folder picker. Hidden pages are excluded outright rather than offered as a toggle — see below.

`src/services/publisher.ts` — static site generator. Renders each node as an HTML page, preserves tree navigation as a sidebar, respects hidden tabs and Secret blocks. **Hidden *pages* are the other half of that and are not optional**: `Node.hidden` shipped 2026-08-10 with nothing yet consuming it, and a publisher that ignores it puts the pages she marked private on a website. It cascades — a hidden page takes everything under it (see `tree-service.ts`'s `isHiddenByAncestor`), so filtering the roots is enough and walking each descendant is not. Bundles a Fuse.js search index as JSON for client-side search on the published site. Same visual style as the app (dark theme, callouts, references as clickable links).

User then hosts the output folder anywhere free (Cloudflare Pages / Netlify / GitHub Pages). Re-publish overwrites.

**End state:** user can share Valeraverse with Nitwit read-only, and Orynthia with the world when it's ready, without any account or backend.

**Not scheduled against Phases 11+ below.** It can land whenever the user wants it; nothing after it depends on it. Its one live argument for going sooner is that it's the existing answer to "people won't install an unknown `.exe`" — see `docs/ideas.md` → Browser version.

---

# Phases 11+ — planned 2026-07-31

Everything below comes out of one planning session: the user brought a list of roughly thirty wants plus screenshots of LegendKeeper's current UI, and the answers to nine scoping questions are baked into the phases rather than left as open questions. Where a phase records a decision, the decision is hers and doesn't need re-litigating.

**Two framing decisions that shape the ordering:**

1. **The "UI overhaul" is two jobs, not one.** The *look* (colour, type, spacing, icons, naming) is CSS tokens and is cheap — done early, everything built afterwards is born looking like Anamnesis. The *layout* (left rail, splittable columns, tabs) rewrites the app shell and touches components that don't exist yet — done early it gets done twice. Hence Phases 11–12 up front and Phase 21 near the end.

2. **The identity pass is deliberately made reversible before it's attempted.** The user's stated blocker was being "extremely picky" with no fixed idea yet. The answer is to ship the theme switcher *first*, so a visual direction becomes a file that can be tried and deleted rather than a one-shot commitment, and then to present complete running directions to react to instead of asking for a design from a blank page. If a future session finds itself asking her to describe what she wants in the abstract, it has taken a wrong turn.

---

**Phases 11, 11.5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 27 are done** — the identity
pass, the design system beneath it, themes, property types, everyday
navigation, the right-click menu's full pass, pictures and tags, the Templates
and Assets tabs, and the project library the start screen became. Their detail
is in `docs/shipped.md`; what still binds the code is in `docs/handoff.md`.
**Phase 18 is next**, and it is the next one in this file. It was scoped on
2026-08-21 and split into 18a, 18b and 18c; they run in that order and 18a
is the one to start.

Two things Phase 12 left behind are in Queued Adjustments rather than here: the
About dialog and the app's default typefaces. Neither blocks anything.

---

## Phase 18 — Sidebar Blocks

The big one, and a genuinely new concept: the right panel becomes a second
block canvas rather than a fixed list of fields. **Scoped 2026-08-21 and split
into three phases** — 18a builds the canvas, 18b builds the index the three
index blocks share, 18c builds the meters. The split is not cosmetic: 18a
changes how every page's sidebar is stored, and shipping that alone means the
data model is proven by use before eleven more block types are built on it.

Keep the distinction sharp in the *user's* language — **properties** are
labelled facts (`Age: 26`), **meters** are arranged widgets (a 75% purple bar
called "Hollow Emperor's Influence"). Underneath, after 18a, they are the same
thing: a block in an ordered list.

**No YouTube, Spotify or map embeds** — LK's media group minus everything that
fetches. Her reason, 2026-07-31, was aesthetic, not the offline policy, which
she has never personally agreed with. If embeds come back that's a policy
conversation to have with her and she'll likely wave it through; ask anyway,
because the boundary is written strict in `CLAUDE.md` at her request.

---

## Phase 18a — The Block Canvas

**Everything in the sidebar is a block, including the properties and the
picture.** Her call, 2026-08-21. There is no fixed region above the blocks and
no special case below them — a brand new page's sidebar is empty except for an
**Add block** button, and every field it ever shows got there because something
added a block. This is the version of the panel with the fewest rules in it,
which is why it's worth the migration below.

**Blocks are views, not storage, wherever the data already exists.** This is
the load-bearing decision and getting it backwards rewrites 18b and 18c. A
block record holds presentation — id, type, optional title, colour, and a
pointer for the ones that point (a property block names its property key) —
while the value stays in the field it lives in today. The reason is that
`node.tags`, `node.image` and `node.properties` are not private to the sidebar:

- `tags` feeds search, `useAllTags`, the tag index block 18b is about to build,
  and LK export.
- `image` feeds the assets tab, the lightbox, `imageFocusY`'s crop, and export,
  which needs `imageSource` beside it.
- `properties` feeds `use-property-index`, the templates in Phase 17, and the
  All Properties modal.

A Tags block that owned its own copy of the tags would silently fork all of
that. Only blocks whose data is genuinely new — Text Box, and the six meters —
store a value inside the block record itself.

**The ordered block list replaces `propertyOrder`, and both must not survive.**
`propertyOrder` is a *partial* list of keys with a default grouping behind it
(see `PropertiesPanel`'s header comment — the grouping is the input to
`orderProperties`, never enforced after). A block list is a total order of
block ids. Once every property is a block the block list is the order, and
keeping `propertyOrder` too means two answers to one question.

**Existing pages derive their blocks on read, not by a migration pass over the
disk.** This is `customProperties`' precedent in `schema.ts` — every read site
falls back itself rather than trusting a load-time migration. A node with no
`blocks` field synthesises one: an image block if it has an image, a property
block per property in exactly the order `orderProperties` returns today, a tags
block if it has tags. The panel then looks identical to how it looks now, the
first edit writes the real list, and nothing rewrites a world she only opened.

**A blank page is blank; a page made from a template starts with whatever
blocks suit that template.** Confirmed 2026-08-21 — empty-by-default is about a
page with no template behind it, not about the templates. Each template carries
a starting block list, chosen for what that kind of page actually needs rather
than applied uniformly: LK's own creature template is the reference she gave,
and it is an image, a Habitat link block, Diet and Summary text blocks and
tags, with Add block pinned under them.

**This is less new than it sounds** — `template-registry.ts` already gives
every template a `properties` array that seeds a new page's sidebar. That array
becomes the ordered block seed, and the work is deciding what else belongs in
each one now that a picture and a link are things a template can start with.
The obvious first call: the templates about a *thing you can picture* —
character, species, location, item — start with an image block, the way the
creature template above does. `note` and `blank` start empty.

Ships in 18a:

- The canvas itself. **Add, remove and reorder are requirements from the
  start** — build it as an ordered collection or this gets rewritten.
- Per-block context menu: title / no title, colour, duplicate, move, remove.
- **Image**, **Text Box**, **Tags**, **Link Block**, and property blocks for
  the four value types Phase 13 built.
- **Every block mutation is its own store action**, the way `setNodeColor` is.
  Phase 19's panel undo is carried over from Phase 10 and is the one place a
  mistake still can't be taken back; it hooks these actions, and a generic
  "write the blocks array" makes it impossible to describe what was undone.

---

## Phase 18b — The Index

**Backlinks, Tag Index and Subpage Index are one job underneath** — an index of
what points at what. Nothing in the codebase computes a backlink today, so this
is built from nothing rather than extended. Build the service once; it serves
all three blocks and is the same data Phase 24's graphs need.

- **Backlinks** — every page whose text links here.
- **Tag Index** — every page carrying a given tag.
- **Subpage Index** — the children of this page, which the tree already knows
  and the sidebar currently doesn't show.
- **Alias** punches above its weight — alternate names that feed search and
  `[[wikilinks]]`, so "Val" finds Valera Jiang. It belongs here rather than in
  18a because an alias is an edge into the same index: a link to "Val" has to
  resolve to Valera's page, and backlinks have to report it as one.

---

## Phase 18c — Meters

Six blocks, two value models, six renderings — build the models first and the
six are presentation.

- **A 0–100 value:** Progress Bar · Circle · Semi-circle · Gauge.
- **N of M discrete pips:** Rating · Token Pool, differing only in whether a
  click sets the level or spends one.

**Token Pool stays in**, questioned 2026-08-21 as a D&D artefact. It isn't one
once Rating exists — the two are the same widget — and counted-in-whole-units
is ordinary worldbuilding: spell charges, rations, favours owed, remaining
heirs, ammunition.

---

## Phase 19 — Safety Net

Unglamorous and probably the highest-value work in this document. This app has already lost user data once (`docs/handoff.md` §Storage).

- **Version history / snapshots / file recovery.** Local, on disk, in keeping with everything else. **Obsidian's "File Recovery" is the shape to copy**, rather than designing one: automatic periodic snapshots kept on disk, a per-file list of past versions you can browse and restore, and arrow-key navigation through that list (the keyboard part is new in 1.13). Copying a known-good model matters more here than anywhere else in this document, because this is the feature that exists to catch the failure that already happened once (`docs/handoff.md` §Storage) and a half-designed version of it is worse than none — it would be trusted.
- **Undo for the right-hand panel** — carried over from Phase 10, still the one part of the app a mistake can't be taken back in. A dedicated store action per operation, the way `setNodeColor` did it.

---

## Phase 20 — Markdown & Folder Import

**Text & Markdown, Obsidian.md, Folder and Zip are one importer wearing four hats** — read a tree of markdown files, map directories to the tree. Build it once.

**Dragging a folder onto the window is the entry point**, and imports the whole thing with its directory structure preserved. Obsidian added exactly this in 1.13 and it's the right front door for an importer that's already directory-shaped: it skips the file-picker step for the case that matters most, and it's the same code path underneath.

JSON and HTML are separate and lower priority. World Anvil is dropped (see `docs/ideas.md`).

**One Import button, more entries behind it — not a button per format.** Settled 2026-08-18: the errand is "bring my world in", and which program it came out of is a detail of the file, not a decision she should have to make before the picker opens. `pickImportFile` in `dialog-service.ts` already has the shape — a filter list plus an All files fallback — so each new importer adds a filter entry and a branch on what the file turns out to be, the way theme import already works out `.css` from `.json` after the fact. The folder-drag entry point above is the exception and stays separate, because a folder isn't something a file picker returns.

---

## Phase 21 — Shell Rework

The layout half of the overhaul. Late on purpose: it rewrites `AppLayout.tsx` and it should only happen once, after the features it has to arrange actually exist.

- Left rail replacing the top bar, with Project / Templates / Assets moved into it.
- Splittable columns — open to the right, open in new tab, open in new window, split right, split down.

---

## Phase 22 — Universes

Decided 2026-08-08. A universe is a top-level container for one version of the world — Canon, Demonic AU, Merfolk AU, Pokemon AU, Timeswap AU — plus a switcher that says which one you're working in.

**A universe is not a row in the tree.** Confirmed by the user 2026-08-08 and it's the load-bearing decision: you change universe from a *selector*, a separate piece of UI, the way Obsidian's vault switcher sits at the bottom of its sidebar rather than as a folder inside it. Obsidian is the reference she pointed at; match that shape.

The tree then shows one universe at a time, at the root. Today an AU character is `AUs / Demonic AU / Characters / Valera Jiang` — four levels of indent before a name, and the `AUs` folder at the top exists only to hold the other folders. In Demonic AU it becomes `Characters / Valera Jiang`. Two levels gone, nothing deleted, and the `AUs` wrapper stops existing.

**Why not just a folder:** a folder can sit anywhere, nest into anything, and means nothing in particular — which is how it got four deep in the first place. Universes can't nest inside each other, can't be dragged into anything, and never appear as a row you can navigate into by accident. Search, collections, graphs and storylines all scope to whatever the selector says, with an "all universes" setting for when she wants the whole project at once.

**Pages true everywhere live in a Shared universe** — a species, a map, a magic system, a language. Decided 2026-08-08 over the alternative of loose pages at the project root. It's always visible alongside whichever universe is selected, so shared lore is never something you have to go and switch to. Keep it visually distinct in the tree; the one thing that must never be ambiguous is which universe the page you're typing into belongs to.

**Following a link out of the current universe switches to it** rather than refusing to open the page. Blocking would be worse than moving, and silently showing a page from a universe you aren't in is how you edit the wrong Valera.

**Cheap on disk, which is the point.** Each universe stays a directory of its own; the container's JSON just gets a template key marking it a universe. `template-registry.ts` already carries `canHaveChildren` per template, so this is a ninth template plus a root-only rule in the reparent guard (`project-store.ts`) and the drop-target check (`TreePanel.tsx`). Nothing about how a page is read or written changes. Existing projects need a one-time migration that lifts each AU out of the `AUs/` folder and marks it — fold it into the Valeraverse re-import already queued above rather than shipping a separate one-off.

**"Universe" is the word**, chosen 2026-08-08 over "AU": Canon isn't an alternate anything, and one word has to cover both.

**Explicitly not building: base profiles with per-AU overrides.** Proposed and rejected by the user the same day, and worth not re-opening. Overrides only pay off when the variants are mostly identical, and hers diverge on species, appearance, history, relationships and most of the prose — the base profile would be pure indirection. It would also put "am I editing canon or this AU?" in front of every keystroke, and turn a character on disk into a base plus a stack of patches, which cuts against the plain-JSON promise. If cross-universe navigation is ever wanted, the cheap version is a plain "variant of" link between pages, no inheritance.

**Sequenced before the three big views** so Collections, Graphs and Storylines are born universe-aware instead of retrofitted — a storyline in particular belongs to exactly one universe. Staying at 22 rather than moving earlier, per the user leaving the call here 2026-08-08: the selector wants somewhere to live, and Phase 21 is what builds the left rail it belongs in. Putting it before that means placing it twice.

---

## Phase 23 — Collections

A filtered table or gallery view over pages, by template or tag. Cheapest of the "big views" and the most useful day to day, which is why it leads them.

---

## Phase 24 — Graphs

Both, per the user's decision 2026-07-31, and in this order:

1. **Relationship graph, scoped to one page** — who she knows, who she serves, what she owns. This is the one that earns its keep.
2. **Global graph** — a view of the whole project at once. Still second, because the relationship graph is smaller and lands sooner, but **it is meant to be a tool, not a poster.** An earlier draft of this entry wrote it off as the thing people screenshot and never use; the user corrected that 2026-08-08 — she wants somewhere to see the whole project, and she specifically doesn't like how Obsidian's is set up.

Obsidian's graph is the thing to beat, so what's wrong with it is the spec. Five commitments, none of them "make it prettier":

- **Nodes have to look like her tree, not like dots.** Obsidian draws every note as the same grey circle, which throws away the one thing this app knows and Obsidian doesn't: templates. Characters, locations, factions and species carry their sidebar icon and her chosen node colour into the graph. This is the single biggest legibility win available and it's nearly free — `constants/icons.ts` and the colour cascade already exist.
- **The same project has to look the same every time you open it.** Force-directed layouts settle differently on every run, so there's no building a memory of where anything is. Seed the simulation deterministically and remember pinned positions.
- **Scoped by default, not everything at once.** One universe (Phase 22), widened on request. Five AUs rendered together is precisely the hairball that makes people close the tab.
- **Filters are visible controls, not a query syntax.** Filter by template and by tag using Phase 23's Collections filter model rather than inventing a second language for the same job.
- **Clicking a node must not throw the graph away.** It opens a preview beside the graph; going to the page is a deliberate second action.

Both run on the reference index built in Phase 18, so neither starts from nothing. D3-force is the likely library.

**Don't ask her to describe what it should look like** — she's said she's picky and has no visual direction in the abstract. Build it against the five points above and let her react to something running.

## Phase 25 — Storylines

Sequence-based narrative trees, asked for 2026-08-08. **This is the app's answer to "what happened next," and it replaces the calendar timeline** rather than sitting beside it — see `docs/ideas.md` → Timeline visualization.

**The distinction that drives the design:** a timeline is date-locked and linear; a storyline is sequence-driven and date-optional. Nodes connect by what leads to what, not by year. Dates are the reason the timeline never got built — a blank the user can't fill and won't guess at stops the writing. Storylines have no such field. Where a date happens to be known it's just another property on the page.

**The view** is a zoomable, pannable, drag-and-drop graph. Each node is a scene or an event; edges run in narrative order. The tree branches for parallel plot threads or alternate viewpoints and reconverges at shared events — so it's a DAG, not a strict tree, and a node can have two parents. Nothing else in the app has that shape; the sidebar tree's model does not fit it.

**Where a node sits is her decision, and the app never overrules it.** Added
2026-08-10. Positions are authored and saved (see Storage below) — a scene goes
where she puts it and stays there. **This rules out inheriting Phase 24's
force-directed layout**, whatever else is shared with it: a force simulation
exists precisely to choose positions for you, and it would spend the session
undoing her arrangement. Phase 24 is right to use one — a relationship graph is
explored, not composed — and that's the difference. What Storylines can take
from Phase 24 is the pan/zoom surface and the edge drawing, not the layout.
Offer a tidy-up as a button she presses, never as behaviour that just happens.

**Loose notes can be dropped anywhere on the canvas.** Asked for 2026-08-10, and
it's the one place a storyline borrows from a whiteboard. Her case is a branch
that stops: a thread ends and the story continues somewhere else, and without
somewhere to say so the reader just finds a dead end. **A note holds links, not
only text** — `continued in [[Demonic AU — Valera's Fall]]` is the whole point,
and it costs nearly nothing because wikilinks already exist and Phase 22 already
decided that following one into another universe switches to it. That turns a
dangling branch into an exit rather than a note-to-self. Notes are annotations,
not nodes: no edges, no page behind them, never counted as part of the sequence.
**Her framing was other people reading it**, which is also the argument for
labelling clusters ("Act 2") — for someone who didn't write the thing, an
unlabelled fork and a fork that stops look identical.

**Every node is also a page.** Opening a node opens a full editor where the whole scene gets written — a storyline is somewhere she writes, not just a map of writing kept elsewhere. Creating a node makes a lightweight page for it by default; pointing a node at an existing page is the other option, and both are first-class, because half the nodes in a real storyline are events that already have pages.

**Storage.** Node pages follow the existing file-per-node model and stay legible on disk. The graph itself — edges, positions, branch structure, and the loose notes — is the new part and wants its own file next to them. Don't scatter edges across the individual pages: a reparent then rewrites two page files, and a failure halfway leaves the graph half-connected.

**Sequenced here because** it wants the reference index from Phase 18 (a scene node should be able to show who's in it), the reworked shell from Phase 21 to host a full-screen canvas, and the pan/zoom and edge rendering from Phase 24 — its *layout*, per the note above, is the one thing not to inherit. It doesn't otherwise depend on Collections or Graphs, so it can be pulled ahead of both if it's what she wants sooner. **A storyline belongs to exactly one universe** (Phase 22) — a fork in reality has its own sequence of events by definition.

## Phase 26 — Teach It To Someone Else

Asked for 2026-08-10 and deliberately placed last: a first-run tutorial for
people who open this app without having watched it get built.

**Not for the user.** She knows it. This is for the people she shares a world
with and for anyone who installs a release — the audience Phase 1.5 (Publish)
serves read-only, and the one person outside this project who has already
installed a build and had to debug it himself.

**Last is the right place, not a parking space.** Phase 21 rewrites the app
shell and Phase 22 changes what sits at the root of the tree, so a tutorial
written before either describes an app that no longer exists. A tutorial that
points at the wrong thing is worse than none — someone following it concludes
the app is broken, not the instructions. Wait for the surfaces to stop moving.

**Nothing is designed here yet, on purpose.** Whether it's an interactive
overlay, a sample project that opens on first launch, or a page inside the app
is a decision for whoever picks this up, with her. The one constraint that's
already fixed: whether someone has seen it is a local setting like every other
(`app-settings-service.ts`) — there is no "did they finish onboarding" to
report anywhere, per the policy boundary in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Phase 28 — Getting It Back Out

Raised 2026-08-14 against LegendKeeper's export menu, which offers five formats
beside its own: HTML, print, Markdown (file or vault), one big text file, and
JSON. Ours offers `.lk` and nothing else.

**Build the shared walker first.** `lk-export.ts`, Phase 1.5's HTML publish and
the queued AO3 export are already the same job — walk the pages, emit another
format — and this adds three more. The note elsewhere in this plan about
extracting the shared piece by the third one is now overdue at six.

- **HTML** — already Phase 1.5 (Publish). Unchanged by this; noted so the two
  don't get built twice. LK's version carries timelines and map pins, which we
  don't have.
- **Markdown** — a vault of `.md` files mirroring the page tree. **Build it
  with Phase 20's importer, not separately.** Same map read in both directions,
  and it supplies the round-trip test that phase wants: export a world,
  re-import it, compare. Obsidian has no export because a vault *is* a folder
  of markdown, so this is also the Obsidian route in both directions. Our
  `[[wikilinks]]` are already Obsidian's syntax, which is the part that would
  otherwise be painful.
- **One big file** — the same walker, one file instead of many. Small addition
  to the above, not its own item.
- **Print** — the only one that isn't "walk and write". **Verified working
  2026-08-14** (Q3 closed): Ctrl+P in the desktop window opens the system print
  dialog and offers Microsoft Print to PDF. What it prints is the problem — the
  whole interface goes onto the page, tree and side panels included. So this
  isn't a capability question any more, it's a stylesheet: a print stylesheet
  that drops every panel and prints the page body, with the title and nothing
  else as furniture. Cheap, and the closest thing to a PDF export we get free.
- **JSON** — **settled 2026-08-14** (Q2 closed): a zip of the world's folder,
  since the data is already JSON files on disk and re-zipping is honest about
  that. **Label it as JSON in the menu** (her call) — people coming from other
  tools are looking for the word, and "Zip" alone doesn't tell them what's
  inside. Something like "JSON (.zip)" with a line saying it's the world's own
  files.

### Templates as files

**Not the same thing as the project templates Phase 27 shipped, and the names
are close enough to be worth saying so.** A `.antpl` is a *project's* shape —
folders, and a blank starter page of each kind, described rather than copied,
with none of anybody's writing in it (`constants/project-template.ts`). This is
a *page* template — one page and its subtree, copied whole, prose and pictures
and all, out of the Templates tab. Different unit, different contents,
different file. Whether the two formats should ever converge is a question for
whoever builds this; the answer is probably not, because "carry their pictures"
below is exactly what a project template deliberately refuses to do.

Templates already copy a page *and everything nested under it*
(`collectSubtree` in `template-library.ts`), so a template that is a whole
folder skeleton is already the shape Phase 17 built. What's missing is
writing one to a file and reading one back — for handing skeletons to people
who are struggling to set their own up. Themes already work this way, so
there's a pattern to copy.

**Templates carry their pictures** (her call, 2026-08-14, Q4 closed) — in case
people want to share skeletons with images in them. So a template file is a
bundle, not a single JSON document: the subtree plus whichever assets its pages
reference, with the references rewritten to point inside the bundle.

**With a switch to leave them out** (her call, same day), so a skeleton can stay
a small file when the pictures aren't the point. That makes both versions the
same format — a bundle whose asset list may be empty — rather than two file
types, so importing doesn't have to care which one it was handed. Show the
resulting size next to the switch; that's the whole reason it exists.

Nothing here touches the network — a template is a file she hands over however
she already hands over files.

## Open Questions — Phases 27 & 28

**All closed 2026-08-14.** Kept as a record of what was decided and where the
answer now lives, because several of these are rules rather than one-off calls.

- **Q2** — JSON export → a zip of the world's folder, labelled as JSON. Phase 28.
- **Q3** — printing → works; needs a print stylesheet, not a decision. Phase 28.
- **Q4** — shared templates → carry their pictures. Phase 28.
- **Q5 / sequencing** → Phase 27 runs next and promptly; the rest sits where it
  makes sense, which is 28 after 20 so Markdown export and the Markdown importer
  are built as one round trip.
- **Q8** — start screen direction → settled; see "The screen itself" in
  `docs/shipped.md` § Phase 27.
- **Q9** — the loud button → New world, centred and alone. Settled by the layout
  rather than argued.
- **Q11** — outside worlds → one list, marked. Shipped; see "The projects folder gets
  read" above.

## Phase 2 — Cloud Sync (Deferred)

Only if the shared-folder sync approach demonstrably stops working. Options in preference order: Supabase (hosted Postgres + auth), Yjs + y-webrtc (P2P CRDT), self-hosted sync server.

Do not scaffold in earlier phases. The file-per-node data model already sets us up well for any of these.
